# Intro-to-Tensorflow-2.x-session

## Session Objectives:

1. Understand the high-level workflow of solving ML problems using TensorFlow 2.x.
2. Explore different applications and ready to use examples of TF in the field of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing
3. Cover low-level details and basic recipes to understand how TensorFlow 2.x works
4. Explore Keras - TensorFlow’s high-level API

## Session Flow

**PART - I**

1. Introduction to Machine Learning/Deep Learning landscape
    * Why we need this? Structured VS Unstructured(Image, text, audio, control)
    * Traditional Algorithmic Approach VS Data-Driven approach
2. Image Classification Problem
    * Why is this a difficult problem for computers to solve?
    * Computer Vision Challenges: [Blog Link](http://karpathy.github.io/2012/10/22/state-of-computer-vision/)
3. Image Classification
    * Food Classifier: (192,192,3) → n classes
4. NLP application intro + Question Answering example

**PART- II**

1. Back to the basics (Linear Regression)
    * parameters(W, b)
    * Loss function (MSE)
    * Optimizer(Stochastic Gradient Descent)
    * Backpropagation
    * Function: F = 1.8×C + 32
2. Keras high level Sequential API

**PART- III**

1. TensorFlow 2.x ecosystem
2. Eager execution
3. Tensorflow Datasets
4. Tensorboard
5. Tensorflow Lite
